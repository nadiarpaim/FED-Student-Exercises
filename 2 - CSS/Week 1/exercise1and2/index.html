        Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars I
        could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now Can we
        pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars I could
        really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
      </p>
      <p class="song">
        Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish To go back to a place
        much simpler than this 'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and
        crashin' And all the glitz and glam and the fashion And all the
        pandemonium and all the madness There comes a time where you fade to the
        blackness And when you're starin' at the phone in your lap And you
        hopin' but them people never call you back But that's just how the story
        unfolds You get another hand soon after you fold And when your plans
        unravel in the sand What would you wish for, if you had one chance? So
        airplane, airplane sorry I'm late I'm on my way so don't close that gate
        If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight And I'll be right back
        at it by the end of the night
      </p>
      <p class="song">
        Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars I
        could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now Can we
        pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars I could
        really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

        Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days Before this was a job,
        before I got paid Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank Yeah,
        back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway And back then I was rappin'
        for the hell of it But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant I'm guessin'
        that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes Then maybe, oh maybe,
        I'll go back to the days Before the politics that we call the rap game
        And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape And back before when I
        tried to cover up my slang But this is for Decatur, what's up Bobby Ray?
        So can I get a wish to end the politics? And get back to the music that
        started this shit So here I stand and then again I say I'm hoping we can
        make some wishes out of airplanes
      </p>

        I could really use a wish right now I, I, I could really use a wish
        right now Like, like, like shootin' stars I, I, I could, I could really
        use a wish right now A wish, a wish right now
